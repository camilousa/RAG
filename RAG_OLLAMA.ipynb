Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we'll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name's Andrew Ng and I'll be instructor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I've worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I'm actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning.
